## Ethereum and Bitcoin-Linked Altcoins Rally

## Understanding Hard Forks and Their Impact  

Hard forks occur when blockchain networks undergo protocol changes that create a permanent split. Disagreements over scalability, transaction fees, and governance have historically led to the creation of projects like Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash.  

### Key Drivers Behind Forks:  
1. **Scalability Debates**: Conflicts over block size limits (e.g., Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash).  
2. **Philosophical Differences**: Ethereum‚Äôs shift to proof-of-stake vs. Ethereum Classic‚Äôs commitment to proof-of-work.  
3. **Community Fragmentation**: Divergent visions for ecosystem development.

## Expert Insights: A Rally or a Correction?  

Ryan McMillin, CIO at Merkle Tree Capital, draws parallels between the current altcoin surge and meme coin rallies. He notes that older tokens benefit from existing recognition and accessibility on major exchanges, attracting retail investors.  

### McMillin‚Äôs Key Takeaways:  
- **Short-Term Momentum**: Retail-driven speculation fuels temporary gains.  
- **Long-Term Concerns**: Projects with stronger fundamentals and active ecosystems are likely to outperform.  
- **Market Reversion Risk**: Prices may normalize once speculative interest wanes.  

McMillin warns investors against chasing the rally, emphasizing the risk of being ‚Äúused as exit liquidity‚Äù when the market corrects.
