## Step-by-Step Guide to Withdrawing Funds

### 1. Verify and Link Your Bank Account

Before initiating a withdrawal, users must ensure their Crypto.com account is fully verified and linked to a compatible **bank account transfer**. Follow these steps:

- **Navigate to the Fiat Wallet**: Access the "Fiat Wallet" section in the Crypto.com app.
- **Add Bank Account**: Enter accurate banking details, ensuring the legal name matches the Crypto.com profile.
- **Complete a Deposit**: Transfer a small amount from the bank to Crypto.com to confirm the link. This step is non-negotiable for enabling withdrawals.

Failure to verify the bank account results in withdrawal rejection, emphasizing the importance of this preliminary step.

#### FAQ: Why is a prior deposit required?
A successful deposit verifies ownership of the bank account, preventing fraudulent activity. This is a regulatory requirement for all retail and institutional accounts on platforms like Crypto.com.

- **Initiate Sale**: Tap "Sell," select "Fiat Wallet" as the destination, and confirm the transaction. The converted fiat will reflect in the Fiat Wallet balance.

Prices are based on real-time market rates, with a small spread applied by Crypto.com to cover transaction costs.
