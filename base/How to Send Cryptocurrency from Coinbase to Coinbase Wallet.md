This transition is particularly important for users seeking enhanced security and autonomy over their digital assets.

Key reasons to consider this transfer:
- **Complete asset control** with self-custody of private keys
- **Reduced counterparty risk** by removing reliance on exchange platforms
- **Direct blockchain interaction** for DeFi participation
- **ERC-20 token compatibility** for expanded crypto ecosystem access
