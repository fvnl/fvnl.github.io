# Risk Disclosure Statement

## Understanding Virtual Assets and Trading Risks

Virtual assets, including cryptocurrencies and digital tokens, represent a revolutionary shift in financial technology. However, their decentralized nature and market dynamics introduce significant risks. This document outlines critical considerations for users engaging with virtual asset trading platforms like OKX. By understanding **Cryptocurrency Trading**, **Market Volatility**, and **Investment Risks**, users can make informed decisions aligned with their financial goals.

## Nature of Virtual Assets

Virtual assets are **not legal tender** and lack government backing. Their value is determined solely by market demand and user confidence. Acceptance as payment or a store of value is voluntary and subject to change. Key risks include:

- **Irreversible Transactions**: Once transferred, virtual assets cannot be reversed, even if sent to the wrong wallet.
- **No Intrinsic Value**: Unlike traditional assets, virtual assets derive value from speculation rather than tangible underlying assets.

## Core Risks of Virtual Asset Trading

### Value Fluctuations and Potential Losses

Trading virtual assets involves **high volatility**, with prices capable of drastic swings in short periods. Factors contributing to this include:

- **Market Sentiment**: News, regulatory changes, or technological advancements can trigger rapid price movements.
- **Liquidity Constraints**: Thin trading volumes may prevent users from exiting positions at desired prices.

> **Example**: Bitcoin's price dropped over 50% in 2022 amid macroeconomic uncertainty, illustrating the **Market Volatility** inherent in this space.

### Past Performance Is Not Predictive

Historical data on virtual assets does not guarantee future outcomes. Prices are influenced by unpredictable variables, making speculation inherently risky.

Diversify your portfolio, use stop-loss orders, and avoid leveraging beyond your risk capacity. Regularly review market trends and platform updates.

## Advanced Risk Categories

### Technology and Cybersecurity Risks

Virtual assets rely on **distributed ledger technology (DLT)**, which is vulnerable to:

- **Smart Contract Bugs**: Coding errors in protocols can lead to fund loss.
- **Cyber Attacks**: Exchanges and wallets may be targeted by hackers, as seen in the 2022 Axie Infinity breach ($625M stolen).

### Regulatory Uncertainty

Governments worldwide are still formulating policies around virtual assets. Sudden regulatory changes could render certain activities illegal or restrict market access.

## Staking and Lending Risks

### Staking Protocols

Staking involves locking assets to support blockchain networks. Risks include:

- **Impermanent Loss**: Value fluctuations during the staking period may reduce returns.
- **Slashing Penalties**: Violating protocol rules can result in partial or total asset loss.
