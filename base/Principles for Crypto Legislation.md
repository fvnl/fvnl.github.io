## Introduction

This guide is intended for Congressional staff and members working on crypto policy. Whether you're new to crypto, lawmaking, or both, our goal is to provide resources for sound policy decisions based on a decade of experience in the field.

Coin Center's mission is to defend the rights of individuals to build and use free and open cryptocurrency networks. We focus on the right to write, publish, read, and run code, assemble into peer-to-peer networks, and conduct transactions privately. Our approach includes policy research, education, advocacy, and litigation to protect digital civil liberties.

Unlike trade associations representing crypto businesses, we advocate for the technology itself as a public good. Cryptocurrency enables decentralized control of assets and transactions, empowering innovation without intermediaries.

## Part I: Understanding "Crypto"

### What Are Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies?

**By Jerry Brito**

Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, emerged in 2009. Its invention solved the "double-spending" problem without relying on third-party intermediaries. Transactions are recorded on a blockchain—a distributed ledger maintained by a global peer-to-peer network. This eliminates the need for centralized authorities like banks.

#### Peer-to-Peer Innovation

Bitcoin's blockchain ensures transaction integrity by distributing ledger copies across nodes. Every transaction is verified against the blockchain to prevent duplication. Users like Alice and Bob can transact directly, bypassing platforms like PayPal. Transactions are denominated in BTC, with value determined by market forces rather than government fiat.

#### Electronic Cash Revolution

Bitcoin mimics physical cash in digital form. Unlike traditional online payments requiring intermediaries, Bitcoin enables direct transfers globally. This innovation has spurred the development of hundreds of cryptocurrencies, each testing features like smart contracts, enhanced privacy, and scalable networks.

### The Broader "Crypto" Ecosystem

The term "crypto" now encompasses:
- **New cryptocurrencies** (e.g., Ethereum, Zcash)
- **Layer 2 scaling solutions** (e.g., Lightning Network)
- **Infrastructure providers**: Miners, stakers, custodial wallets, exchanges
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Non-custodial tools for trading, lending, and stablecoin issuance
- **Open-source developers**: Core devs and smart contract devs building transparent software

Communities within this ecosystem range from individual hobbyists to enterprise teams, all contributing to decentralized financial infrastructure.

## Part II: Ten Principles for Effective Crypto Legislation

### 1. Problem-Focused Policymaking

Legislation should address specific issues like consumer risks, money laundering, or market inefficiencies. Begin by identifying how crypto's unique attributes (e.g., decentralization) exacerbate or mitigate these problems. Evaluate existing regulatory frameworks before proposing new laws.

### 2. Technology-Neutral Approaches

Avoid discriminatory standards favoring traditional financial systems. For example, anti-money laundering (AML) laws should apply equally to crypto and fiat currencies. Over 90% of illicit funds still flow through banks, yet crypto faces disproportionate scrutiny.

### 3. Risk-Calibrated Regulation

Target activities, not technologies. Custodial services (e.g., exchanges) pose different risks than non-custodial tools like wallets. Bitcoin miners, for instance, lack transaction control, making traditional banking regulations inappropriate.

### 4. Prioritizing Trusted Intermediaries

While crypto enables disintermediation, most users rely on custodial services. Regulate these intermediaries as "least cost avoiders"—entities best positioned to mitigate systemic risks. Direct regulation of individual users or software developers should be a last resort.

### 5. Free Speech Protections

Cryptocurrency software constitutes protected speech under the First Amendment. Developers cannot be compelled to add surveillance features or restricted from publishing open-source tools. Exceptions apply for fraudulent conduct or services involving personal user relationships (e.g., investment advice).

### 6. Fourth Amendment Compliance

The third-party doctrine allows warrantless data collection from trusted intermediaries. However, non-custodial entities like miners or open-source developers lack user data, requiring warrants for surveillance. Legislation must distinguish between these roles.

### 7. Avoiding Regulatory Overreach

Congress must define regulatory boundaries clearly. For example, stating "licensed parties shall maintain adequate capitalization" delegates implementation details but retains legislative authority. Avoid granting regulators unchecked power to define scope.

### 8. Clarity Over Ambiguity

Excessively broad laws create enforcement disparities. For instance, classifying all blockchain validators as financial institutions would burden millions of individuals. Clear definitions ensure fair application and prevent arbitrary enforcement.

### 9. Procedural Due Process

Legislation imposing penalties must guarantee trial rights, legal representation, and appeals. Measures like Treasury's special sanctions powers risk constitutional violations if applied without judicial review.

### 10. Foreign Nexus Requirements

Sanctions targeting crypto networks must exclude U.S. persons to comply with constitutional protections. For example, banning all crypto transactions without distinguishing foreign actors could infringe on domestic rights.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q: Why is Bitcoin considered regulated despite common misconceptions?
A: Bitcoin transactions fall under existing laws like AML requirements and tax regulations. FinCEN's 2013 guidance clarified that intermediaries (e.g., exchanges) must comply with the same rules as traditional financial institutions.

### Q: How do crypto regulations impact decentralized finance (DeFi)?
A: Non-custodial DeFi platforms generally don't require licensing, as they lack control over user funds. However, developers offering personalized financial advice or custodial services face regulatory obligations.

### Q: What challenges do lawmakers face in drafting crypto legislation?
A: Rapid technological evolution, jurisdictional complexities, and balancing innovation with consumer protection create persistent hurdles. The decentralized nature of crypto networks complicates traditional enforcement mechanisms.
