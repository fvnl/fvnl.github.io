## Understanding Node Wallets: The Blockchain Backbone

### Decentralized Infrastructure Explained

Node wallets like TP Wallet aren't just storage solutionsâ€”they're active participants in blockchain networks. Unlike custodial wallets, node wallets maintain full copies of blockchain ledgers, enabling direct network interaction. This architecture:

- Enhances transaction transparency through real-time ledger updates
- Eliminates third-party intermediaries
- Provides users with complete private key control

For example, TP Wallet's implementation allows users to validate transactions independently, reducing reliance on centralized authorities while maintaining security through cryptographic protocols.

### Security Advantages in Practice

Node wallet users benefit from:
- **Zero counterparty risk**: Direct blockchain access removes exchange-related vulnerabilities
- **Immutable transaction records**: Every transfer is permanently etched into the blockchain
- **Customizable privacy settings**: Advanced users can employ features like stealth addresses
